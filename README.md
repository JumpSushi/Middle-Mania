## Game Brief

To score points in the game, you must hit the target when it is in the center of the screen. To earn points, the player must time their button presses so that the dot is in the middle row. As the player accrues more points, the target advances more quickly, and the difficulty of the level rises.

The LED sprite first moves randomly across the screen when the game begins. When the LED sprite is in the center of the screen, the player shall push the A button. The LED sprite advances more quickly and the player receives a point if they successfully press the center A button. The game ends and the player's score is shown on the screen.

The player wins the game by scoring as many points as possible before failing to press the A button in the middle. The game ends when the player fails to press the A button in the middle and their score is displayed on the screen.
